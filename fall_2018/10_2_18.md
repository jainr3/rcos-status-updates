Rahul Jain- Passive Frequency Detection Project - 10/2/18 Status Update

## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Over the past week, I continued to familiarize myself with the project information located on our trello page (https://trello.com/b/YvH3h3Hy/passive-cell-phone-detection) and I learned more about how to use git. 

## This Week's Plan

>Investigate the project information on the trello page and gain a better understanding of how to fully model and test the previous circuit. In the future, I am planning on modeling and testing more circuits that may work better.
>I also want to eventually improve our github and trello pages by adding more information about the project

## Anything Blocking?

> I was not able to insert the LM358 operational amplifier in LTspice as the built-in library of components does not have this particular operational amplifier. I will continue to research alternate operational amplifiers and see if they will be compatible with our circuit.
