Rahul Jain- Passive Frequency Detection Project - Fall 2018 Summary

## Semester Summary

 Being new to the project and RCOS, I did not have as much experience working with the tools needed for this hardware project but I learned more about the operational amplifiers, frequency ranges of cell phones, and I have attempted to simulate the LM358 Operational Amplier Circuit in LTspice. I was not successful in doing this simulation, but it taught me a great deal about how to use this software more effectively. Most importantly, I taught myself how to use Git and did my status updates from the command line. Overall, I found RCOS to be a very beneficial supplement to my studies at RPI.
 
## Semester Accomplishments

The following are a brief summary of accomplishments during the semester. Please see my status updates for more detailed information.

Weeks 1 through 4
- I familiarized myself with the project page and research done by past members of project.
- Began to model pre-existing circuit to better understand it. (Was not completely successful)
- Learned how to use basic GitHub commands for first time. (status updates: https://github.com/jainr3/rcos-status-updates/tree/master/fall_2018)
- Researched alternate power detector chips that would be compatible with circuit. 
    - Research yielded CA3130 chip to be compatible (https://trello.com/c/UUAKzGuW/21-ca3130-op-amp-circuit)
    - Attempted to model new circuit design to better understand it

Weeks 5 through 8
- Prepared for large group presentation by gathering research done so far
    - Includes CA3130 Op-Amp circuit model & possible improvements from this design
    - Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xKZEQR9TrmWlEVV4kHKsxWB0d_N3NRdKeo8BwIs9UYs/edit?usp=sharing
- Learned how to model transistors in LTspice as they are essential for amplification and rectification of our signal. 
- Made the "commit" to our trello page: https://trello.com/c/UUAKzGuW/21-ca3130-op-amp-circuit
    - Added specifications sheets for op-amps
    - Did some brief research into using Arduino with the circuit
- Researched parts that would be required for implementation of the project
    - Created a comprehensive list of parts & specifications
- Learned how inverting & non-inverting operational amplifiers work (these are the most basic)
    - Getting this foundational understanding was necessary in preparation for understanding the actual circuit

Weeks 9-10
- Skimmed through research document found by Gavin Allcorn (https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&context=ceendiss)
    - Interesting to see more in-depth research done on possible designs
- Acquired parts that were necessary for the project
- Built a prototype using comparable parts and documented results on trello page
	- Prototype is functional and we have pictures of circuit
	- Like previous design it has a short range

## Issues during semester

- Modeling the circuit using LTspice software took longer than planned and had trouble coming up with comparable parts
    - Trouble comparing CA3130 to OP37 or others
- Lag period when we needed to "wait" for parts

## Future prospects

In the future, we would like to improve certain hardware aspects of the project. This would include increasing the range of the device, amplifying the signal, and removing excess noise (filtering). Our progress during this semester was good as we were still learning more about how different components work together and how the project comes together. Aside from making hardware improvements, we want to conduct further tests on our prototype so that we can acquire meaningful data that can be analyzed and interpretted. Personally, I believe that documentation for hardware projects is crucial as projects that lack a core software component are hard to pick up after multiple semesters. Documentation could include detailed design descriptions, schematics, measurement plots vs simulation plots, and flow charts. I think that our biggest strength this semester was the trello page which allowed us to effectively organize our ideas.
