Rahul Jain- Passive Frequency Detection Project - 11/6/18 Status Update

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Over the past week(s), I continued research into the CA3130 operational amplifier.
> I revised a commit to our trello page (https://trello.com/c/UUAKzGuW/21-ca3130-op-amp-circuit) adding in information about pricing for parts that can be acquired online.


## This Week's Plan

> See if the CA3130 Op-Amp is compatible with Arduino.
> Continue researching other Op-Amps that might work better.
> I also want to continue improving our github and trello pages by adding more information about the project.
> Get the pricing proposal document reviewed and approved so we can order parts that are necessary.

## Anything Blocking?

> After finding the CA3130 Op-Amp, I am not sure if the OP37 chip in LTSpice will model this particular OP-Amp successfully.
> I also noticed that the OP37 chip only has 5 pins while the CA3130 has 8 pins. I need to ask our group leader about this further.
