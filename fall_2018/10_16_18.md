Rahul Jain- Passive Frequency Detection Project - 10/16/18 Status Update

## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Over the past week, I continued to familiarize myself with the project information located on our trello page (https://trello.com/b/YvH3h3Hy/passive-cell-phone-detection).
>I continued looking into data sheets for power detector chips that may be compatible.

## This Week's Plan

> Continue to look into power detector chips that are compatible, looking at previous research of what worked and what did not work.
> Investigate the project information on the trello page and gain a better understanding of how to fully model and test new circuits.
> I also want to eventually improve our github and trello pages by adding more information about the project.

## Anything Blocking?

> I am still not having much luck in finding new power detector chips that are compatable.
> I am still not able to insert the LM358 operational amplifier in LTspice as the built-in library of components does not have this particular operational amplifier. I will continue to research alternate operational amplifiers and see if they will be compatible with our circuit.
