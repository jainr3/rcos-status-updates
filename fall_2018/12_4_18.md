Rahul Jain- Passive Frequency Detection Project - 12/4/18 Status Update

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> As we are entering the building phase of our project, I visited a lab in the JEC building and acquired some resistors/capacitors that are necessary.
> Researched a similar circuit for an audio amplifier and tried to understand it.
> I skimmed the document found by Gavin about a study done on cellular detection technology.
> Over the past week(s), I continued research into the CA3130 operational amplifier.
> I did some more research into operational amplifiers. I learned more about inverting and non-inverting operational amplifiers and their applications.
> I learned that the additional pins would not be used in the LTspice model, but would be used in the actual circuit.

## This Week's Plan

> Acquire the remaining parts that are needed for the building portion of the project.
> See if the CA3130 Op-Amp is compatible with Arduino.
> Continue researching other Op-Amps that might work better. Learn more about our circuit.
> I also want to continue improving our github and trello pages by adding more information about the project.

## Anything Blocking?

> After finding the CA3130 Op-Amp, I am not sure if the OP37 chip in LTSpice will model this particular OP-Amp successfully.
> I was not able to acquire the operational amplifier and need to ask Gavin/others if they can help.
