Rahul Jain- Open Circuits Project - 2/8/19 Status Update

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Over the past week, I joined the OpenCircuits project and began to familiarize myself with the technologies involved.
> I installed NPM, PHP, SQLite, and successfully built the program on my local machine. I also was able to run the local program on a local host.

## This Week's Plan

> Write some unit tests for some of the basic logic gates and run them.

## Anything Blocking?

> When I tried to run the program on a local host, I was not able to do so on host 8080 due to some permission errors. To get around this, I was able to run it and view the website on host 8081.
