Rahul Jain- Open Circuits Project - 4/5/19 Status Update

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week we have started to work on Unit Tests for the ToolManager which is an object that basically controls the different tools (selection, rotation, etc).
> I am working with Rohan Patel to create these unit tests for ToolManager.test.ts (tests\public\ts\utils\tools\ToolManager.test.ts).
> My plan is to use multiple tools at once in succession so that we can test the switching between tools.

## This Week's Plan

> Finish the ToolManager.test.ts file.
> Continue to investigate the language with which the program is written and prepare for another task in the future.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing too difficult. Still learning the language.
