Rahul Jain- Open Circuits Project - 2/8/19 Status Update

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I wrote 2 unit tests and pushed my code to the GitHub page. The unit tests were for the XOR and OR gates which have *relatively* simple logic. 

## This Week's Plan

> Continue to investigate the language with which the program is written and prepare for another task in the future.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing too difficult. Still learning the language.
