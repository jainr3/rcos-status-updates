Rahul Jain- Open Circuits Project - 3/22/19 Status Update

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> For the last few weeks I have been working on adding Unit Tests for tools. I have specifically been working on the RotateTool.test.ts and have modeled it off of code from the PanTool.test.ts. 
> My code places down an ANDGate, selects it and rotates it 90 degrees in the 3rd and 4th quadrants.
> I have been helping Rohan Patel with Wiring Tool / Selection Tool code.

## This Week's Plan

> Continue to investigate the language with which the program is written and prepare for another task in the future.
> Finish up the RotateTool test and continue on.
> Keep working on the Wiring Tool code.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing too difficult. Still learning the language.
