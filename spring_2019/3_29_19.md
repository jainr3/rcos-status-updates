Rahul Jain- Open Circuits Project - 3/29/19 Status Update

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I have been helping Rohan Patel with Wiring Tool / Selection Tool code. 
> The code is mostly completed and has been pushed to tool_tests branch on OpenCircuits repo (https://github.com/OpenCircuits/OpenCircuits).


## This Week's Plan

> Continue to investigate the language with which the program is written and prepare for another task in the future.
> This week we have started to work on Unit Tests for the ToolManager which is an object that basically controls the different tools (selection, rotation, etc).
> I am to work with Rohan Patel to create these unit tests for ToolManager.test.ts (tests\public\ts\utils\tools\ToolManager.test.ts).
> My plan is to use multiple tools at once in succession so that we can test the switching between tools.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing too difficult. Still learning the language.
