Rahul Jain- Open Circuits Project - 4/12/19 Status Update

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week we have finished the Unit Tests for the ToolManager which is an object that basically controls the different tools (selection, rotation, etc).
> My test clicks a switch, wires the switch to the led. Then it selects the objects & rotates them. I test to make sure that the different tools are being switched to and that we have instances of them while they are working but not after.

## This Week's Plan

> Prepare a slide for the presentation that is coming up.

> Ensure that Leon is aware of the tool_tests branch that we have committed our changes to.
> Continue to investigate the language with which the program is written and prepare for another task in the future.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing too difficult. Still learning the language.
